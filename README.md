# Klaf
The application is designed to help you memorize foreign words using the mnemonic method.
The method is based on working with card decks and repeating them with a certain interval.<br/>
The app calculates the time until the next repetition and sends a notification about the need to repeat the deck. 
If each subsequent repetition takes the same amount of time as the previous one or
 less, the time interval before the next repetition will be increased. 
If the repetition takes a longer time, then the interval before the next reminder will be decreased.
